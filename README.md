**Monokai Nebula** is deep and vivid Monokai-inspired theme for the Zed editor.

My goal is to improve contrast over many other Monokai themes, while enhancing the overall beauty and readability of text.

This theme provides custom colors for almost every themeable element in the editor, giving way to default values where a more "native" feel is appropriate. For those that use colaborative editing, up to 5 users will have theme-appropriate colors.

Bright colors over a dark (but not black) background make it easier to read.

Unlike other monokai themes, Nebula treats docstring like regular comments, reducing visual noise.

Special attention was paid to ensure the terminal follows the same visual consistency.
