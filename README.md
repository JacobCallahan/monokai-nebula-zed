**Monokai Nebula** is deep and vivid Monokai-inspired theme for the Zed editor.

My goal is to improve contrast over many other Monokai themes, while enhancing the overall beauty and readability of text.

This theme provides custom colors for almost every themeable element in the editor, giving way to default values where a more "native" feel is appropriate.
